## Project Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```

2. Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
   npm install
```
   Or if you are using yarn
```bash
   yarn install
```

3. Configure Environment Variables

   If your project uses environment variables, create a .env file in the root directory:

```bash
   touch .env
```

   Add the necessary environment variables inside the .env file:

```bash
   APP_NAME=
   REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

4. Start the Development Server

   Run the following command to start the React development server:

Using npm:
```bash
   npm start
```
   Using yarn:

```bash
   yarn start
```

This will start the app on http://localhost:3000/ by default. \

```
